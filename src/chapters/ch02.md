#Opening

All was dark, and that darkness was bliss.  Theo reached up and snugged the strip of cloth that he'd tied over his eyes.  It blackened out most of the room, but during the high sun of the day enough light came into his small bedroom that he was aware of faint glowing to the bottom and tops of the cloth.  No matter how tight he tied it, there was always some light that got in.

Over the last week, his hearing seemed to improve.  He spent his time listening to the heavy thud of his father's boots tromping around the house - periodically during the days work of wool shearing.  Theo grunted and pounded his fist into his mattress.  He felt terrified, helpless, and frustrated all at once.  He knew very well that their harvest would be short.  They may have to give up some of their flock over to the Keorgans, who'd managed their own flock quite well this year.

Theo's father, Beor, took all things in stride.  He was a walking stone to anyone who knew him.  Occasional smiles and chuckles with the few friends he had were a rarity.  But Theo knew that there was strong feeling that ran in his father, although deep and distant.  Beor loved him, and he was concerned more than he let on about Theo's condition.

The boy stood up and made a deliberate effort to listen.  The old cabin was silent - his father was out.  His hands shook as he slowly pulled up the cloth from his closed eyes and opened them.  Warm golden sunlight flooded his vision.  For a brief few seconds he was blind, awash in white.  Then it slowly faded and he saw everything clearly.  

His bedroom was well aged oak floors, walls, and a layered thatch roof.  Stacks of washed work leggings and shirts that he hadn't bothered to put on were laying on and over a solitary wood chair in the corner near a tall shelf.  On that shelf were the things he most cherished, stories and recounts of history.  They were stacked sideways and longways.  They had clefted page corners and bookmarks throughout.  Some had lost their bristle and covers and were merely stacks of paper held together with twine.  He looked at them with longing and sadness, sighing.

There was a bowl of water and damp clothes on the small table next to his bed that Raethe used to tend to him.  He scowled as he noticed it, but another part of him felt shame and embarrassment.  She'd consistently come as her duties to the town as a healer, but was unable to find out what the problem was.  Granted, he wasn't helping her at all.  Most of their talks ended with him tightening up his cloth, turning away from her, and demanding that she leave the room for her own safety.  

Theo looked into the water bowl and saw his haggard face.  It was gray and oily from days without wash.  Slow black stubble spread around his chin and cheeks.  His shoulder length hair hung at odd angles from the night's sleep.

His green eyes had lightly discolored rings under them.  He stared at his own eyes and fought back a fresh wave of fear.  He half expected an episode to happen again, like it usually did with other people.  Some unknowable curve of light that inscribes some odd shape on their eyes.  All their eyes.  It was as if some writing was there, some inscription.  And even more disturbing, he had this funny impression that they had always been there and maybe he was seeing them for the first time.  But then he would look, he would really look to find it out.  And that's when his mind would break and dazzling colors were everywhere.

Theo shook his head as if flinging water.  Delusions, this was the disease and how it worked.  He closed his eyes as if the submission to his struggle could make some difference in overcoming the illness.

A sizable window looked out over the gently sloping grazing fields.  He stopped clutching his head long enough to see about 10-20 sheep huddled together by their shaggy grey dog, Biscuit, who was sitting vigilantly watching over them.  He seemed to become alert and moved swiftly to his feet, watching keenly in the direction of the path to their home.  He inwardly groaned, it must be Raethe come for her daily work.

Within a few moments he heard the approach of a creaking wagon.  His father would have seen them coming and met them at the threshold.  He heard voices speaking.  More than two?  It did sound that way.  Soon footsteps were heard in the house.  His father's solid thuds and a scatter of lighter feet alongside.  Back to his room.

"Son?" His father called from outside his door.  The sound of his father's voice rung like a painful note against his ribs.  He missed him, but he had to be safe.  He couldn't risk seeing his father go through the same thing.  "Please, stay out." He replied loudly.

Beor pressed gently, "Raethe is here, but also an important visitor who might help you."

Theo sighed, an admittance of his helplessness and quickly tied the cloth back over his eyes.  "Fine."

As the concerned man opened the door to the boy's room he stepped aside to allow the girl and herself through.  She walked into the small room, firstly noticing no smell of illness.  The boy himself, sat up on his bed with a ragged blindfold tied around his head.  He was still and slowly followed them as they walked into the room, picking spaces where they would be easily out of each other's ways.
